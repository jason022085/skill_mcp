## 📖 What is Skill MCP Server?

Skill MCP Server is a standard [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server that bridges Claude Skills to any AI agent that supports MCP.

</p>

Previously, Claude Skills were mainly used in Anthropic's official tools. If your AI application doesn't support Skills, you'd have to implement your own parsing and execution logic, which is a hassle. With this project, you can simply configure it and let any MCP-compatible Agent use standard Skill files directly.

## 💡 Core Concepts

- 🔌 **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: Think of it as a "USB interface" for AI. As long as your AI assistant supports this interface, it can connect to various tools and services.
- 📦 **Claude Skills**: Think of them as "skill packages" for AI. They're not just documentation — they include instructions (`SKILL.md`), accompanying scripts (Python/JS), and reference materials.

Skill MCP Server is a "converter" that helps various agents use the Skill ecosystem, enabling plug-and-play functionality.

## 🌟 Why Choose Skill MCP Server?

If your Agent doesn't support Skills yet, this project can help you quickly integrate:

| Dimension | Natively Supported Agents (e.g., Claude Code) | Other Agents (with this project) |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Access Barrier | Deep integration, usually non-portable | Low barrier, standard MCP protocol |
| Development Burden | Official implementation complete | Zero code, no need to build Skill parser |
| Flexibility | Tied to specific clients | Cross-platform, works with any MCP-compatible agent |
| Feature Parity | Full script, resource & file stream support | Perfect alignment, same dynamic execution & resource access |

## ✨ Features

- 🛠️ **Highly Standardized**: Strictly follows MCP protocol
- 🌍 **Universal Compatibility**: Not tied to any vendor, works with all MCP-compatible AI clients
- ⚡ **Zero-Code Integration**: Helps agents without native Skill support quickly access the Skill ecosystem
- 📦 **Fully Compatible**: Supports `SKILL.md` format and `scripts/`, `references/` resource directories
- 📂 **Workspace Isolation**: Supports `--workspace` parameter to specify where Skill output files are stored
- 🌐 **Remote Connection Support**: Built-in HTTP/SSE server with API Key authentication, making it easy to create a shared team skill library
- 🔄 **Hot Reload**: Add new skills without restarting the server
- 🔒 **Secure by Design**: Path validation, sandboxed file operations

## 🚀 Quick Start

Recommended: Use `uvx` to run without manual installation.

### 📥 Installation

```bash
# Using pip
pip install skill-mcp-server

# Using uv (recommended)
uv pip install skill-mcp-server
```

### ⚙️ Configure MCP

Add Skill MCP Server to your MCP client configuration. All MCP-compatible clients use the same configuration format:

**Using uvx (recommended, no installation needed):**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "skill-server": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "skill-mcp-server",
        "--skills-dir", "/path/to/your/skills",
        "--workspace", "/path/to/workspace"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Using local installation:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "skill-server": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": [
        "-m", "skill_mcp_server",
        "--skills-dir", "/path/to/your/skills",
        "--workspace", "/path/to/workspace"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Configuration file locations:**
- Claude Desktop: `claude_desktop_config.json` (location varies by OS)
- Claude Code: `~/.claude.json`
- Other MCP clients: Refer to your client's documentation

**Parameter Explanation:**

- `--skills-dir`: Core parameter. Set to the root directory containing all Skill folders you want your agent to use.
- `--workspace`: Important parameter. Specifies where Skill execution output files (code, reports, etc.) are saved.

## 🎮 Interactive Demo

The project includes a simple terminal MCP client (`examples/demo.py`) that lets you interactively test your Skills directly using OpenAI models.

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Set your OpenAI API Key
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

### Mode 1: Local Execution (Stdio Mode)
This is the simplest way to test. It directly mounts a local skills directory and automatically starts the server in the background:
```bash
# Navigate to the examples directory
cd examples

# Run demo.py (specifying skills directory and optional workspace)
python demo.py --skills-dir ./skills --workspace ../workspace
```

### Mode 2: Connect to Remote Server (SSE Mode)
If you want to test connecting to a standalone Skill Server over the network:
```bash
# 1. In terminal 1, start the remote server with API Key authentication
SKILL_MCP_API_KEY="my-secret-token" python -m skill_mcp_server

# 2. In terminal 2, use demo.py to connect via URL with custom Headers
cd examples
python demo.py --url http://localhost:8000/sse -H "Authorization: Bearer my-secret-token"
```

## 🛠️ Available Tools (MCP Tools)

Once connected, your AI agent can use the following tools:

1. 🔍 `list_skills`: List all available skills
2. 📚 `skill`: Load a specific skill to get detailed instructions from its `SKILL.md`
3. 📄 `skill_resource`: Read reference documents or templates from skill packages
4. ▶️ `skill_script`: Execute scripts bundled with skills in a secure environment
5. 📖 `file_read`: Read files from the specified workspace
6. ✍️ `file_write`: Write files to the specified workspace
7. ✏️ `file_edit`: Edit existing files in the workspace

## 📝 Creating Skills

A standard Skill structure looks like this:

```
my-skills/
└── deploy-helper/           # Skill folder
    ├── SKILL.md             # Core documentation (required)
    ├── scripts/             # Executable scripts
    └── references/          # Reference materials
```

**SKILL.md Example:**

```markdown
---
name: deploy-helper
description: Help users deploy applications to production with one click
---

# Deploy Helper Usage Guide

When users request deployment, follow these steps:
1. Use `skill_resource` to read the deployment template.
2. Modify local configuration files.
3. Call `skill_script` to execute the deployment script.
```

### SKILL.md Format

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: Brief description of what this skill does and when to use it
---

# My Skill

## Overview

Explain what this skill enables the AI to do.

## Usage
